$\begin{bmatrix}x,y,z\end{bmatrix}R_{3\times 3}
= \begin{bmatrix}x_t, y_t, z_t\end{bmatrix}$

each row of the matrix represents one axis of a cartesian coordinate system

$R_{3\times 3}^T\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\\ z\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}x_t\\ y_t \\ z_t\end{bmatrix}$


We can do this by implicitly treating points as Homogenous points but to continue using them in a Cartesian coordinate system (as Cartesian points), we need to be sure that w, this fourth coordinate, is always set to 1.

- Most of the time, the matrices we use to transform a point will have their fourth column set to (0, 0, 0, 1), and with these matrices, the value of w' should always be 1. 
- However, in special cases (projection matrix, shear transform), the value of w' might be different than 1, in which case you will need to normalize it (we divided w' by itself), which requires to also divide the other transformed coordinates x', y' and z' by w'.

>  $\omega$ is always equal to 1. However, if the matrix we are multiplying the point with is a **perspective projection matrix**, the result of w' might be different than 1.

vectors do not need to be translated because their position is meaningless. 
Vectors can be transformed like we transformed points, but we can remove the part of the translation.
